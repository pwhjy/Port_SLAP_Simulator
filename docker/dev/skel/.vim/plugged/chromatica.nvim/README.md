# chromatica.nvim

Chromatica is an asynchronous syntax highlight engine for Neovim. It is
a python3 remote plugin. Currently, chromatica focuses on providing
semantic accurate syntax highlighting for C-family languages (using
libclang).

The project is in alpha state, but it is fairly stable and usable now.

## Features

* Asynchronous parsing and highlighting provides fast and responsive highlight
  as you update your code.
* Semantic-accurate highlighting for C-family languages.

### Example

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arakashic/chromatica.nvim/master/figures/comparison_c.png" width="100%"/>

## Prerequites

* [Neovim][3] 0.1.6 or newer
* [Python3][4] and [Neovim python client][5]
* [libclang][6] (prefers 3.9.0 or newer)

### Known Incompatibility

* Python2 (sorry, Python3 only)
* Some syntax plugins (depending on the loading order, third-party
    syntax plugins may overwrite/mess up Chromatica's highlight)

## Installation

### Install Prerequites

Install neovim python client and latest clang
```bash
pip3 install neovim
brew install llvm
```

### Install Chromatica

Use a plugin manager (for example, Neobundle)

```vim
NeoBundle 'arakashic/chromatica.nvim'
```

Or manually check out the repo and put the directory to your vim runtime
path.


## Essential Settings

Like many other clang-based plugins, a path to your libclang is needed.
Chromatica will default to `/usr/lib/libclang.so`, but you can specify a
different one by setting

```vim
let g:chromatica#libclang_path='/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib'
```

The path can be set to either the path of the libclang.dylib/libclang.so
file, or the directory that contains it.

If you want Chromatica to be automatically loaded at startup, you will
need to set

```vim
let g:chromatica#enable_at_startup=1
```

Alternatively, you can manually enable and disable Chromatica by calling,
respectively, `:ChromaticaStart` and `:ChromaticaStop`.

## Compilation Flags

Chromatica already has flags for simple codes. To provide the most
accurate highlighting for complex projects, chromatica needs to know the
correct compilation flags such as include search path and macro
definitions. There are two ways to do that in chromatica.

1. A compilation database `compile_commands.json`.

    This is usually generated by CMake. If the project does not use
    CMake, you can generate it using [Bear][7].

2. A `.clang` file that has the compilation flags.

   The `.clang` file allows you to manually set the flags. For example:

   ```
   flags=-I/home/arakshic/.local/include -DNDEBUG
   flang=-I/../src
   ```

   Each `flags` option can have one or more compiler arguments. A
   `.clang` file can have multiple `flags` options. They will be
   concatenated in the order of their appearance.

When chromatica initializes, it search the current directory and the
ancestor directories for these two files. If both file are present,
chromatica will combine the flags in them.

For convenience, you can also set the
`g:chromatica#dotclangfile_search_path` option to the directory that you
put the `.clang` file or the compilation database. It overrides the
default search directory.

If preferred, you can set the `g:chromatica#search_source_args` option to
have Chromatica search the compilation database for similar filenames, if an entry
for the current file is not found. (This is especially useful if your
compilation database does not contain entries for header files). Currently,
this just searches the database for the current file's base name, with the extensions
.c, .cc, .cpp, or .cxx.

## Highlight Feature Level

Chromatica provides different feature levels. Each level enables a
different set of highlight. This is controlled by
`g:chromatica#highlight_feature_level`. 

The default level is 1, which let Chromatica handles most of the token
in the code. A modified `c.vim` will be load for the highlighting the %
format specifier and other stuff that a parser does not understand.

Setting it to 0 would limit Chromatica to handle only the identifiers
and literals. This is only recommended if you have a slow machine and
are experiencing performance issue with the full functionality of
Chromatica. Note the `$VIMRUNTIME/syntax/c.vim` will be loaded in this
case and may exhibit highlight conflicts in some scenarios.

## Responsive Mode

By default, chromatica only updates highlight when returned to normal
mode after changing the buffer. This is quite awkward since you may have
changed thousands lines of codes, but the highlight will only be updated
when you finish those changes and return to normal mode.

Chromatica provides a responsive mode that reparses and updates the
hightlight as soon as you change the code (in insert mode). To use the
responsive mode, simply set

```vim
let g:chromatica#responsive_mode=1
```

in your vimrc.

Note that the responsive mode comes at the cost of frequent reparsing
the buffer. Even when the highlight is done asynchronously, frequent
reparsing can still cause performance (editor responsiveness) problem if
you C++ code is super complex (Yes, I haven't experienced this problem
with C code). Chromatica uses pre-compiled header to speed up the
repasing and throttles the number of reparse requests per seconds to
avoid reparse flooding. You can increase `g:chromatica#delay_ms` if you
still experiencing performance issues.

## Common Issues

It is reported in issue #52 that the libclang may be missing one
include directory on Linux, which causing incorrect highlight. You can
fix it by adding the missing directory through global arguments. The
following is an example.

```vim
let g:chromatica#global_args = ['-isystem/usr/lib/llvm-6.0/lib/clang/6.0.0/include']
```

Since OSX Mojave, the XCode command line tools does not create
`/usr/include` any more, which breaks the LLVM from homebrew. You might
need to run the following command to manually install it. More details
can be found at [here][8].

## Troubleshooting and Customization

When a token is not highlighted or not highlighted correctly, the first
thing to check if whether Chromatica has the correct compilation
arguments. Because Chromatica uses the clang compiler parser, it is very
important to get all the compilation arguments right. For example, if
the compiler cannot find some of the header file, it may lead to some
tokens does not get highlighted. The command `ChromaticaShowInfo` will
print the basic information for the current buffer including the
location of `.clang`, compilation database, compilation arguments, etc.

Chromatica has a debug log. It can be enabled by executing the
`ChromaticaEnableLog` command (for one time use) or set the
`g:chromatica#enable_log` option. It will generate a `chromatica.log`
file in the current directory.

```sh
installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /
```

Chromatica also provides a AST dump feature that is useful for the users
who want to customize the highlight settings. Simply executing the
`ChromaticaDbgAST` will generate a `AST_out.log` file in the current
directory. It contains the parsed tokes in the visible part of the
buffer. The file is color-coded using terminal colors. You might need to
manually enable the parsing of color code in your pager or reader. I
would simply do a `less -R` on it.

For the following sample code

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
{
    return 0;
}
```

The `AST_out.log` is

```
include chromaticaInclusionDirective [1, 2, 7] PREPROC IDENTIFIER INCLUSION_DIRECTIVE 
iostream None [1, 11, 8] IDENTIFIER INVALID_FILE 
int chromaticaType [3, 1, 3] KEYWORD FUNCTION_DECL FUNCTIONPROTO INT NONE 
main chromaticaFunctionDecl [3, 5, 4] IDENTIFIER FUNCTION_DECL FUNCTIONPROTO INT NONE 
int chromaticaType [3, 10, 3] KEYWORD PARM_DECL INT NONE 
argc chromaticaParmDecl [3, 14, 4] IDENTIFIER PARM_DECL INT NONE 
const chromaticaStorageClass [3, 20, 5] KEYWORD PARM_DECL INCOMPLETEARRAY NONE 
char chromaticaType [3, 26, 4] KEYWORD PARM_DECL INCOMPLETEARRAY NONE 
argv chromaticaParmDecl [3, 32, 4] IDENTIFIER PARM_DECL INCOMPLETEARRAY NONE 
return chromaticaStatement [5, 5, 6] KEYWORD RETURN_STMT NONE 
0 Number [5, 12, 1] LITERAL INTEGER_LITERAL INT NONE 
```

Each line represents one token. Following the token's spelling, there is
the name of syntax group. This syntax group is what you need to set
customized highlight. If a token does not match any syntax group, it
will be shown as `None`.  Then, there is the position of the token in
`[line, start column, length]` format. The rest fields are the raw info
of the token which are useful for debugging when some token is not
correctly highlighted.
